This is different from normal hair, which can have various textures but generally has a smoother surface.\n\n### Combined Condition\nWhen these two features occur together, it's referred to as keratoderma with woolly hair. This condition is typically inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning both parents must carry the gene for the child to develop the condition.\n\n### Examples of Conditions That Include This Feature\n1. **Dyskeratosis Congenita (DC)**: This is a rare syndrome characterized by nail abnormalities, skin pigmentation changes, and increased risk of cancer.

While most pilomatricomas are benign, there is a small risk that they can transform into a more aggressive form called a pilomatricoma carcinoma. However, this is very rare. If you have a suspicious growth on your skin, it's always a good idea to have it evaluated by a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.

It is also known as a calcifying epithelioma of Malherbe. Genetic changes in pilomatricomas have been studied, and here's an overview:\n\n### Genetic Alterations\n\n1. **TP63 Gene Mutations**:\n   - The most common genetic change in pilomatricomas is the mutation in the TP63 gene. This gene plays a crucial role in the development and differentiation of skin cells, including those of the hair follicle. Mutations in TP63 can lead to abnormal cell growth and the formation of pilomatricomas.\n\n2. **Other Genes**:\n   - While TP63 mutations are the primary genetic alteration, other genes may also play a role. However, these are less commonly studied and understood compared to TP63.\n\n### Mechanism of Action\n\n- **TP63 Gene Function**: Normally, TP63 helps regulate the growth and differentiation of cells in the epidermis and hair follicles. Mutations in this gene can disrupt these normal functions, leading to the formation of pilomatricomas.\n\n- **Cell Differentiation**: In pilomatricomas, cells that would normally differentiate into mature keratinocytes", "rejected": "Pilomatricoma is a type of benign tumor that develops from the hair follicle. The exact genetic causes of pilomatricoma are not fully understood, but some genetic mutations have been linked to this condition. One of the most common genetic changes associated with pilomatricoma is a mutation in the PADI6 gene. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that plays a role in the normal differentiation of cells in the hair follicle. The mutation in PADI6 can lead to the formation of pilomatricoma by disrupting the normal differentiation process and causing the cells to behave abnormally. Other genetic mutations have also been identified in some cases of pilomatricoma, but more research is needed to fully understand the role of genetics in this condition. It's important to note that not all pilomatricomas have a known genetic cause, and some may be idiopathic, meaning the cause is unknown.

There is no strong evidence to suggest that they are inherited in a typical Mendelian pattern (like autosomal dominant or recessive).\n- **Genetic Factors**: While there is no known genetic mutation directly linked to pilomatricoma, some cases have been associated with other genetic conditions like Gardner syndrome or multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A.

The treatment for pilomatricoma generally involves surgical removal, as this is the most effective way to ensure complete resolution of the lesion. Here’s a detailed explanation:\n\n### Surgical Removal\n- **Reasoning:** Surgical excision is the standard treatment because it allows for complete removal of the tumor tissue. This reduces the risk of recurrence, which is relatively common with other treatment methods.\n- **Procedure:** A surgeon will make an incision around the pilomatricoma and carefully remove the entire mass along with a margin of normal tissue to ensure complete removal.\n- **Recovery:** After surgery, there may be some pain and swelling, which can be managed with over-the-counter pain relievers and cold compresses. Full recovery typically takes about 1-2 weeks.\n\n### Risks and Considerations\n- **Infection:** Any surgical procedure carries a small risk of infection.
